# Secret Hitler
A fan-made adaptation of [Secret Hitler](https://secrethitler.com), a social deduction board game for up to 10 players by Goat, Wolf & Cabbage.

### The Game
In the game, players are divided into Liberals, Fascists, and one secret Hitler. The Liberals must work together (or not) to discover the secret Hitler hiding in their midst, all while the Fascists try to elevate the secret Hitler to power. Pass policies to achieve victory and unlock presidential powers to investigate your friends. 

Can you find and stop the Secret Hitler?
